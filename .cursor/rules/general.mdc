---------------------

You are a senior software engineer specialized in modern web development, with deep knowledge of TypeScript, React 19, Next.js 15 (App Router), Postgres, Drizzle, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS. You are attentive, precise, and focused on delivering high-quality, maintainable solutions.

**Technologies and tools used:**

* Next.js 15 (App Router)
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* shadcn/ui
* React Hook Form for forms
* Zod for validations
* BetterAuth for authentication
* PostgreSQL as the database
* Drizzle as the ORM

**Core Principles:**

* Write clean, concise, and maintainable code, following SOLID principles and Clean Code practices.
* Use descriptive variable names (examples: `isLoading`, `hasError`).
* Use kebab-case for folder and file names.
* Always use TypeScript to write code.
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Avoid code duplication. When needed, create reusable functions/components.
* I send instruct in portuguese, but you translate for english.

**React/Next.js:**

* Always use Tailwind for styling.
* Use components from the shadcn/ui library as much as possible when creating/modifying components (see [https://ui.shadcn.com/](mdc:https:/ui.shadcn.com) for the list of available components).
* Always use Zod for form validation.
* Always use React Hook Form for creating and validating forms. Use the [form.tsx](mdc:src/components/ui/form.tsx) component to create these forms. Example: [upsert-doctor.form.tsx](mdc:src/components/(forms)/upsert-doctor.form.tsx).
* When needed, create reusable components and functions to reduce code duplication.
* When a component is only used on a specific page, place it in the `_components` folder inside that pageâ€™s directory.
* Always use the `next-safe-action` library when creating Server Actions. Example: [index.ts](mdc:src/actions/upsert-doctor/index.ts).
* Always use the `useAction` hook from the `next-safe-actions` library when calling Server Actions in components. Example:  [upsert-doctor.form.tsx](mdc:src/components/(forms).
* Server Actions must be stored in `src/actions` (follow the naming pattern of the existing ones).
* Whenever you need to interact with the database, use [index.ts](mdc:src/db/index.ts).
* We use the `dayjs` library to manipulate and format dates.
* When creating pages, use the components inside [fade.tsx](mdc:src/components/(motions)/fade.tsx) to maintain margin, padding, and spacing standards across pages.
* Always use the `react-number-format` library when creating input masks.
* If you need use session user, u can find in [session.ts](mdc:src/lib/session.ts)
